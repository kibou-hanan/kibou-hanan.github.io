                      <p class="card-text">29% of retailers expect an increase in the overall volume of sales for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 12% expecting a decrease, according to the High Commission for Planning (HCP).
                        In its recent note on the results of its quarterly business surveys in wholesale trade and non-financial market services, HCP said this change is mainly explained by the expected increase in sales in “Wholesale of food and drink,” and “Other specialized retailers.”
                        Orders planned for Q4-2021 would be at a normal level according to 80% of business leaders, and employment would experience stability in the workforce according to 91% of retailers.
                        In the third quarter of this current year, sales of the Wholesale trade sector on the local market remained stable according to 58% of retailers and increased according to 25% of retailers, says the same source.
                        This change is mainly due to the increase in sales in “Wholesale of food and drink products,” “Other specialized retailers,” and, on the other hand, a drop in sales was noticed in “Wholesale of information and communication equipment.”
                        During the third quarter of this year, employment remained stable according to 71% of business leaders, HCP said, adding that 80% of retailers reported normal stock levels. The observed trend in selling prices was stable, according to 64% of business leaders, and increased according to 30%.</p>
