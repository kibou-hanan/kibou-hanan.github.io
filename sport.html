<p class="card-text">
  Moroccan golfer Inès Laklalech obtained her access card with a full category to the Ladies European Tour (LET), says the Royal Moroccan Golf Federation.
  “After 5 rounds of the Ladies European Tour (LET) Qualifying School final, Inès Laklalech gets her access card with a full category thanks to a 15th place ex-aequo and a cumulative score in the Par”, adds the same source.
  The amateur player of the High-Level Pole of the Royal Moroccan Golf Federation will join Maha Haddioui on the European Women’s Tour during the 2022 season, the statement points out.
  After the first week of competition, only 75 players were able to reach the final qualifying round for the LET, which was played from December 16 to 20, alternating between the southern and northern courses of the Real Golf La Manga Club in Spain’s Murcia.
  Two Moroccan players, Inès Laklalech and Lina Belmati, respectively from Royal Golf Anfa Mohammedia and Royal Golf Dar Es Salam, were among the 128 qualifiers for this event, which was played in 5 rounds with a cut after 72 holes qualifying only the 65 best players and ties.
  At the end of the 5th and last round, the 20 first ones in the ranking obtained the “Full Category” for the LET, that is to say, complete access to the competitions of the calendar of this female circuit.</small></p>

<p>The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced the provisional suspension of six top Moroccan tennis players this December 14.
  The cases were adjudicated by an independent anti-corruption hearing officer, Charles Hollander, who found the players guilty of various match-fixing offenses back in July of this year, in addition to charges of receiving money for fixing and failing to report corrupt approaches.
  The ITIA investigation found that the players’ offenses were linked and therefore were subject to a joint hearing.
  Six months later, the ITIA issued the final sanctions against the Moroccan players. Amine Ahouda is banned for 11 years and fined $5,000, Anas Chakrouni, banned for 10 years and fined $5,000, Ayoub Chakrouni is banned for life and fined $10,000.
  Mohamed Zakaria Khalil is banned for 9 years, fined $5,000, while Soufiane El Mesbahi is suspended for 9 years and fined $5,000, and Yassir Kilani, banned for 9 years, is fined $5,000.
  The sanctions mean that the players are prohibited from playing in or attending any tennis event authorized or sanctioned by any international tennis governing body or national association for the length of their bans.
  The players’ suspensions begin from the date of their provisional suspension – 13 July 2021 and they have 20 business days </p>
